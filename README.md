# 🧩 Libft

**Libft** is my very first C library — a project from the 42 curriculum that challenges you to rebuild essential parts of the C standard library from scratch.  
It’s all about learning how memory, strings, and data manipulation truly work under the hood. No shortcuts, no hidden magic — just raw C. 🧠

## 📘 What It Does

Libft provides a custom collection of fundamental C functions.  
It includes tools for working with:
- **Characters and strings** — handling text efficiently
- **Memory management** — allocating, copying, and comparing bytes
- **Conversions** — turning text into numbers (and back again)
- **File descriptors** — printing output to different destinations

It’s not just about rewriting `strlen()` — it’s about understanding why `strlen()` works the way it does.  
Every function was built, tested, and debugged manually, which means every segfault has taught me something new. 😅

## ⚙️ Building the Library

You can build the library using the included Makefile:

make

Other useful commands:

make clean     # remove object files
make fclean    # remove object files and the library
make re        # rebuild everything from scratch
